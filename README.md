# PanelLoadCombination
Load combination of average loads

Assumptions:
No SC ID is duplicated (if the same SC ID exists twice one average is done with all the loads)
All cases have the same elements (element count or IDs are not checked, thus is cases contain different elements, the resulting average is meaningless)
